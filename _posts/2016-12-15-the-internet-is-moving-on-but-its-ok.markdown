As a preface, this isn't a technical post, but an opinion piece on the state of
the 'internet'. If hearing something potentially divisive isn't your thing, it
might be best to skip this one.

This past week, YouTube's yearly rewind video came out. Usually the name of the
video is titled something related to a popular song from the year, and this one
was no different. 

- notes
    - there are dozens of comments on the video about how it is bad because
        characters are not recognizable or relevant
    - point to 2012 being the relevant video, a good one
    - why are people saying this?
    - thought about it, and came up with a few points
    - 1. people in 90s grew up with youtube, facebook, etc through highschool
        and college
    - 2. our group of people were the people that knew the most, spent the most
        time, so naturally we know the landscape
    - 3. my opinion: as time goes on, the experience of the internet and of
        digital content is changing
    - it is no longer 'owned' by our age group, and we might not be the most
        knowledgeable 
    - a new 'sector' of the internet, or fragmentation of how people experience
        it is happening
    - a younger new generation is experiencing a different version of these
        things that have traditionally been 'our' thing (youtube, for example)
    - seeing the new things that we don't necessarily identify or latch on to
        causes us to lash out at the new that we don't understand.

conclusion:
    - youtube, and digital content on the internet is changing, and will
        continue to as time goes on.
    - it will be different than what we're used to, but our age group doesn't
        own the internet or youtube just as much as anyone else, although we
        may have been at the beginning.
     - a reverence for the old does not require a disdain for the new.

Potential Counterpoints:
- youtube is trying to make their videos more diverse so they icnlude more
  global - true
