Recently I had lunch with a few people and the topic of [risk compensation][compensation] came
up. Also referred to as the Peltzman Effect, risk compensation is a theory that
suggests that people change their behavior in response to pereceived risk. For
example, some claim that the introduction of seatbelts has had no net positive
effect because drivers began driving faster because of it. If you read the
Wikipedia article, you'll see more proposed cases of risk compensation in areas
of sports, safety equipment and health.

We talked about the NFL and the rise of concussions (or recognition of them)
as well as helmet technology around it. One interesting thought that came up
was the idea that the birth of the modern football helmet has led to an
increase in dangerous activity by players. Now that the safety equipment worn
by players is perceived to be very safe, it leads to players making more risky
decisions. When players previously wore [leather helmets][leather], they might
be more unwilling to lead a tackle with their head because of the obvious risk.
On the other side, now that helmets seem so safe, players are more willing to
tackle with their head first. Recent [rules][rules] in the NFL are trying to
eliminate helmet tackles so this example of risk compensation might no longer
be relevant.

Later I began thinking of how other changes in technology might trigger similar
behavior adjustments. The most obvious that comes to mind is the rise of
blindspot detection and pseudo self-driving cars. As drivers get used to their
car's computer warning them when a car is coming up behind them, their
perception of the risk of changing lanes might change. While I have never
driven a car like this before, I can imagine that drivers will slowly check
less and less when they are changing lanes or maneuvering on the highway. In
due time as technology matures and more cars become self-driving, the
actual risk might disappear as drivers no longer are responsible for making
decisions on the road.

In the lull between cars of today and the driverless cars of tomorrow,
I believe that risky behavior by drivers of pseudo smart cars will increase.
Drivers might no longer check their lanes or even take their hands completely
off the wheel. In the summer of 2016, a [man was killed][killed] when his Tesla
ran into the back of a large 18-wheeler. Ever since the release of the
'autopilot' feature, Tesla has tried to convince drivers to keep their hands on
the wheel even when the feature is on. Unfortunately many drivers hear the word
autopilot and trust it too much, especially while the technology is in its
infancy. Until we reach completely autonomous cars, I'm afraid accidents like
this might continue as drivers fail to realize the actual risk while on the
roads.

As technology moves forward in mission-critical areas like healthcare,
transportation and heavy industries, I'm curious to see how the divide between
perceived and actual risk (hopefully) narrows.
