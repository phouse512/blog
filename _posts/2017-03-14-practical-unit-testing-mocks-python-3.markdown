Over the course of writing production Python the past year, I've learned a bit
about writing effective unit-tests as well. Here is a collection of some of the
common use-cases I've come across while writing tests in Python.

Mocking
/- mocking methods of a class
/- mocking out imported libraries
/- mocking objects

Mock Behavior
    returning multiple values
    asserting multiple method calls
    asserting exceptions thrown
