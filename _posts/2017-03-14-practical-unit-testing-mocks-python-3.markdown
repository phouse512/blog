Over the course of writing Python in the past year, I've learned a bit
about writing effective unit-tests. Here is a collection of some of the
common use-cases I've come across while writing tests in Python.

[Unit Testing](#unit_test)

> [unit test basics](#test_basics)<br />
> [unittest.TestCase](#test_case)<br />
> [ what do you test?](#what_test)<br />

Mocking

> mocking methods of a class<br />
> mocking out imported libraries<br />
> mocking objects<br />

Mock Behavior

> returning multiple values<br />
> asserting multiple method calls<br />
> asserting exceptions thrown<br />

### Unit Testing {#unit_test}

Why should you write tests, why are they important?

#### Unit Test Basics {#test_basics}

What is a unit test?

#### unittest.TestCase {#test_case}

Using unittest.TestCase to run your tests

#### What Do You Test? {#what_test}

What to test? hmm
