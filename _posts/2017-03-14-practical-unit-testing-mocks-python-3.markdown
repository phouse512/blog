Over the course of writing Python in the past year, I've learned a bit
about writing effective unit-tests. Here is a collection of some of the
common use-cases I've come across while writing tests in Python.

Unit Testing
: unit test basics
: unittest.TestCase
: what do you test?

Mocking
: mocking methods of a class
: mocking out imported libraries
: mocking objects

Mock Behavior
: returning multiple values
: asserting multiple method calls
: asserting exceptions thrown
