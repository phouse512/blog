Reflecting on 2016, I began thinking about all of the tools I use on my
computer for programming, productivity and the web. For tools that we use
everyday, we have lots of shortcuts and subtle habits here and there. This post
is the first in a series documenting my workflows and tools I use on a regular
basis. Below is a half-baked list of upcoming posts (the order may change):

- vim and plugins
- ack and jq
- Todoist
- Gmail
- upstart
- jekyll
- to be continued..

### mypy

As I've learned and written more Python and Java, one of my biggest complaints
about Java has been the lack of any sort of typing. Quite a few bugs I've
created would've been discovered before run-time with Java, for example. About
8 months ago, a coworker shared about a tool called `mypy` for Python that
helps when working with larger codebases.
