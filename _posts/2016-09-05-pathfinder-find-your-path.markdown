The past few weeks I've had some extra time to start the framework for
a project I've been incubating for a long time. I was at a hackathon long ago
in college, and our idea was related to helping people who wanted to figure out
how to go from point A to point B in terms of knowledge. For example, let's say
you're a senior in college studying computer-engineering, but you've realized
you are far more interested in becoming a data scientist. While you might not
be able to switch majors like that and start over, there's enough information
on the Internet that you should be able to learn.

The problem is, unless you have someone close to you with that domain knowledge
of how to get started, it would be pretty hard to know how get to that point B,
becoming a data scientist. This idea came from that need - helping to provide
learning paths for people who want to learn something that they don't
necessarily know how to learn. Knowing **how** to learn something is just as
important, if not more so, than actually knowing the topic in question. I could
talk much more about that, but I'll leave that for another day. For now, just
understand that at the core of our idea, we wanted to teach people how to learn
stuff, rather than to teach them the concept itself. As many hackathon projects
go, we left that weekend and did not end up continuing to work on it, but it
stuck in the back of my head for the next year or so.

[Pathfinder][pathfinder] is the brain-child of that old project. I decided to
cut down the scope of it so that it would help people learn real-world useful
applications that could be hard to string together from simple Google searches.
For example, instead of help someone become a web-developer, Pathfinder teaches
someone how to build, test, and deploy a Django web-application from start to
finish.

Long-term, I would love to be able to help give someone a **free** path to the
career interest or skill of their choice, but I figured I would start with
helping to unmystify the things that I actually had to learn myself in the
past. I figure that sharing learning tracks of real, useful skills will benefit
some people and ultimately help them learn how to learn any technology they
want in the future.

I'm currently working on adding new tracks, and I'm open to
any ideas or thoughts you may have on things you would like to learn, or things
you know people around you would like to learn. Shoot an email to **help at
pathfinding.space** if you have any thoughts or feedback!

This is definitely a work-in-progress, and as I gather feedback and try new
topics, I'll be sure to update here about it.
