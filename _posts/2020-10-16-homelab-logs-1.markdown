Being a homeowner has opened up a world of projects both digital and physical,
especially with a dedicated garage. This post will be the first in a long
series about the various projects I take on, both as a personal record and as a way
to share the interesting things learned along the way. I'm titling the series
the Homelab Logs, as a homage to the [homelabbers][homelab]. Although that
community is centered around sysadmins and DIY technologies, I hope to emulate 
that spirit of experimentation and learning in my approach to improving and
upgrading our home.

These logs will not be as long or include as much writing as my usual posts,
but will be a combination of photos and descriptions of the process. You can
also tell from my numbering schema that I plan on writing many of these, and
checking-in my work [early and often][codinghorrorearly].
