Being a homeowner has opened up a world of projects both digital and physical,
especially with a dedicated garage. This post will be the first in a long
series about the various projects I take on, both as a personal record and as a way
to share the interesting things learned along the way. I'm titling the series
the Homelab Logs, as homage to the [homelabbers][homelab]. Although that
community is centered around sysadmins and DIY technologies, I hope to emulate 
that spirit of experimentation and learning in my approach to improving and
upgrading our home.

These logs will not be as long or include as much writing as my usual posts,
but will be a combination of photos and descriptions of the process. You can
also tell from my numbering schema that I plan on writing many of these, and
checking-in my work [early and often][codinghorrorearly].


### Office Cabinets

With the intro out of the way, here is a brief overview of one of my biggest
woodworking projects to date: an office cabinet for storage and organization.
It was based on standard cabinet dimensions, and I built 3 drawers on the
cabinet on the left, and 2 full length drawer slides on the right for easy
access.

I've never built cabinets from scratch, and it was a great learning experience
for my next time around. The cabinets were built with baltic birch plywood, and 
the drawer faces and doors were all cut from a single piece of maple
plywood, for a continuous edge between them.
