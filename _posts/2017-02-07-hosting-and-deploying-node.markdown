this is to be a blog post about hosting and deploying node



### hosting node

go into setting up nvm

install forever

### deploying node

talk about why you want to rsync your build, and not run webpack up there

for small projects, doing this from local is fine, for bigger projects, use
jenkins or a deploy server to help standardize your testing process

go into using `rsync` to deploy and send code
