Spent some time back at home with the family this past week/weekend, and had
the chance to relax and enjoy life with them. One thing in particular I was
reminded of (by example, and not just in word) was the importance of diligence
and the *slow* way of doing things. By *slow* I don't just mean slow in the
sense of time, but a careful, devoted, and deliberate effort with which one does
things.

Doing things this way is full of substance, not flash. It is diligent, it
doesn't lose sight. It requires unwavering commitment, even when change doesn't
happen fast. It carries things through to completion, and doesn't leave a trail
of starting lines behind. It takes careful listening and conscious thought,
without giving into the thinking of the times. It comes from a discipline
within, not from the approval of others. It stands as a rock amidst the reeds
in the daily current of life. It speaks in action and character, not just in
words.

Ultimately, this is the narrow and hard path, not the wide and easy one. May
God grant us the strength.
