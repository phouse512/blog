This weekend a few college friends and I went up to Devil's Lake in Wisconsin
for some hiking and an overnight camping trip. I've never been camping up in
Wisconsin before, and the lake and the hiking on the bluffs above it were
amazing. Grilling on the lake and enjoying the sunset capped off an already
great day.
