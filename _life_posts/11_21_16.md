What are you doing now that will make you proud when you're 30? Doesn't have to
be money, fame, or something like that. The things that you do in your free
time and in your job are the important things. Will this be something that you
would be proud to tell your friends, your nephews or your neighbors about? Is this
something you could be writing about now so that you don't forget?
