I've been in Shenzhen for a little over a week now, and I'm adjusting well.
Working at HAX has been a crazy awesome experience so far, and I have no
regrets so far. Being surrounded by such smart, talented, and motivated is
a very exciting experience. In the meantime, I've churned out a small project
to help me remind me to look away from my computer screen, and I'm working on
a small journal application. I will post it when it is more developed here!
