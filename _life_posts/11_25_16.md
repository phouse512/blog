I've been thinking about getting a camera to help document my adventures and
the ups and downs of starting a company. I know some of my friends have taken
some really nice photos with the small mirrorless cameras in the past few
years. In particular, the [Sony a6000][a600] has looked promising and it
doesn't break the bank like other mirrorless cameras out there.

However since I have a habit of being trigger happy with buying new technology,
I'm going to try something new this time. I have an iPhone camera already, so
for the next few months I'm going to work on improving the quality of photos
I take with it. While the quality is not as great, taking good photos still
requires skill that a new camera won't magically give me.

There are a few sites out there that offer tips and composition ideas for your
photos, so each week I'm going to try to focus on one style of photo and take
a daily photograph that meets that criteria. We'll see if I improve enough to
make a new camera worth it.
