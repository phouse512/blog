Today I cooked [chicken tikka masala][recipe-link] for the first time from
a recipe found online. It took quite a few spices, but turned out fantastic.
Next up, it's time to learn how to bake [naan][naan-link] to compliment it.

I've been documenting all of my recipes and cooking and I think I'll be putting
them online soon.
