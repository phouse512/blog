Today I rode down to Navy Pier from Evanston. There's a portion of the route
that requires you to ride along the road, but fortunately there are street
markers that guide you from the end of the Evanston trail area to the Chicago
Lakefront Trail. I've marked the route below because for some reason when
I googled it, I wasn't able to find the route anywhere online.
