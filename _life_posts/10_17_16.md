Last week I had a chance to go to Hong Kong and visit a friend. I did two
hikes, one leisurely hike and one really intense once. Visiting Hong Kong
and spending some time around the city itself is pretty amazing, and I hope to
come back. I don't really know if I would want to live there for a long time,
but it's fun to visit!
