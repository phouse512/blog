Hi! My name is Phil, and I'm a software engineer currently at [Sprout Social][sprout-social] in Chicago. I work in the world of web services and distributed systems, and usually find myself writing Java and Python, although lately I've been playing with Go.

This is a space for my personal projects, things that I've learned along the way, as well as any other random thoughts of mine. Feel free to email me or tweet at me with anything you'd like to talk about :)

P.S. I might find the time one day to spruce up the design of this place, but that's not exactly my strong suite.
