Hi! My name is Phil, and I'm currently the CTO of [Amper][amper], a small hardware startup in the (crowded) IoT space. I formally was a software engineer at [Sprout Social][sprout-social] in Chicago. I work in the world of web services and distributed systems, and usually find myself writing Java and Python, although lately I've been playing with Go.

This is a space for my personal projects, things that I've learned along the way, as well as any other random thoughts of mine. Feel free to email me or tweet at me with anything you'd like to talk about!

Here are some things I'm interested in:

- home automation: when I say home automation, I'm not just talking about
  an array of devices you control from your phone. The smart home should
  require less interaction from its inhabitants, not provide it with more
  interfaces with which to control it.
- learning: the vast amount of information now available at our fingertips is
  mindblowing, but for someone with 0 knowledge of how to get from novice to
  expert, the knowledge dump of the internet doesn't always work. We just need
  to figure out how to organize it.
- making things: I like making things, and I like talking and working with 
  people who also like to make things.
- self-driving cars: my opinions on this are long and best saved for a future
  blog post.
- personal data: the amount of data that exists for a single person is huge.
  I'm not just talking about the number of web services with API's that 
  someone is signed up for. Think about everything in your life, the time you
  spend here or there, when you cook, when you eat out, what kind of stuff do
  you own, what are all the books you've read, etc. There are literally
  thousands, and I'm curious how to collect it all and index it in an efficient
  manner.
