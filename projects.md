When I'm away from work and have the time, I enjoy working on a few projects, most of which relate to home and personal automation. Here's a few of the more recent ones that I've been working on:

- piper: an api built in Django and Golang that is the glue of all the services I run for my personal automation. It handles querying external API's for data to aggregate and send downstream to other mediums, such as the Amazon Echo, tablets, etc.

- <unnamed project>: privacy focused tools, currently a work-in-progress
