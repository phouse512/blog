When I'm away from work and have the time, I enjoy working on a few projects, most of which relate to home and personal automation. Here's a few of the more recent ones that I've been working on:

- piper: an api built in Django that is the glue of all the services I run for my personal automation. It handles querying external API's for data to aggregate and send downstream to other mediums, such as the Amazon Echo, tablets, etc.

- [pathfinder][pathfinder]: a project built to help friends and internet
  strangers who are trying to become programmers. If you want to learn more,
  check out my blog post and check out pathfinder itself at the link on the

I previously did undergraduate research at the [Delta Lab][delta-lab], working on a project related to learner-sourcing - an approach where motivated learners can contribute to larger, social and human computation problems.
