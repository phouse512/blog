When I'm away from work and have the time, I enjoy working on a few projects, most of which relate to home and personal automation. Here's a few of the more recent ones that I've been working on:

- piper: an api built in Django that is the glue of all the services I run for my personal automation. It handles querying external API's for data to aggregate and send downstream to other mediums, such as the Amazon Echo, tablets, etc.

- lacuna: an experiment with running jenkins on a Raspberry Pi to trigger other time-based services.

I previously did undergraduate research at the [Delta Lab][delta-lab], working on a project related to learner-sourcing - an approach where motivated learners can contribute to larger, social and human computation problems.
